Arithmetic Progression
An arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. 
For instance, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, . . . is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2.
If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is and the common difference of successive members is , then the -th term of the sequence is given by:
 

Sum of AP series is given by -


Derivation of Sum Formula: 
	
To derive the above formula, begin by expressing the arithmetic series in two different ways:



Adding both sides of the two equations, all terms involving d cancel:


Dividing both sides by 2 produces a common form of the equation:

An alternate form results from re-inserting the substitution:

Geometric Progression -
A geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence, is a sequence of non-zero numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. 
For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with a common ratio 1/2.
The general form of a geometric sequence is  where r ≠ 0 is the common ratio and a ≠ 0 is a scale factor, equal to the sequence's start value.


The n-th term of a geometric sequence with initial value a = a1 and common ratio r is given by
